# js-design-patterns
I am going to try and do the design patterns in the simpler way possible. Let's see.

### We use patterns broadly to do 3 work:
1. **To create an Object** - *Creational Patterns* -  How are we creating an object is very important.
2. **To compose an Object** - *Structural Patterns* - How are we adding properties to the Object.
3. **To make the Object communicate with other objects** - *Behavioral Patterns* - How is our object going to communicate with other objects.
