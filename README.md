# js-design-patterns
I am going to try and do the design patterns in the simpler way possible. Let's see.

### We use patterns broadly to do 3 work:
1. **To create an Object** - *Creational Patterns* -  How are we creating an object is very important.
2. **To compose an Object** - *Structural Patterns* - How are we adding properties to the Object.
3. **To make the Object communicate with other objects** - *Behavioral Patterns* - How is our object going to communicate with other objects. 

### Creational Patterns
1. **Singleton Pattern** - When we could create only one object out of a class. Only one instance. A new instance is not needed at all. For ex, Console.log(). We do not create a new object for it everytime.
